**NOTE** : This is currently a work in progress.

One of the components is responsible for the spatial relation computation. It makes a 3d representation of the world state and computes properties to describe relations between objects (such as _isIn, isOn, isNextTo_) and affordances of agents toward objects (_canSee, canReach_). One can make requests concerning the relative position of entities toward an agent's point of view. This kind of requests enhance the robot with a geometrical perspective taking ability to talk to the human with his own references, improving the social aspect of the system.

## Facts computation
The fact list will be given once the module integrated to the toaster architecture.

## Inputs
This module subscribes to topics /agent\_monitor/factList and /area\_manager/factList.

## Outputs
It does computation in 3-dimensions and publishes facts like isVisible, isReachableBy, isOn, isIn on /move3d\_facts/factLsit topic.

## Services
This component has no services.

## Example
As an example the facts (simplified here) **BLUE\_BOOK isIn BOX1** or **HUMAN1 canReach BOX1** can be generated by this module.It can also tell the relative position of an entity, compared to another, from the agent's perspective. For example, it makes possible for the robot to tell to the human "the mug you are looking for is "**on your right**" or "please give me the book which is **for you on the left of the red mug**".
