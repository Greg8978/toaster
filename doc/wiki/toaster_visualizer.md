## How to use
To start the toaster_visualizer ros node, run the following command on terminal -

```shell
> rosrun toaster_visualizer
```

To visualize you need to launch rviz as well:

```shell
> rosrun rviz rviz
```

## Description
To understand the situation and visualize the internal processes, a visualization module is rendering the names and 3d models at the position of the entities and the areas with their names.
This visualization simplifies the debugging process and allows a faster setup of the framework parameters. This module is designed to create a simple 3d representation of toaster's physical elements in RVIZ.

## Implementation details
To use rviz with TOASTER, follow the configuration instructions at https://github.com/Greg8978/toaster/blob/master/toaster_visualizer/doc/toaster_visualizer_doc.pdf. The figure below, explains the implementation of this module.

## Inputs
It uses the position of the entities published by the data gathering component and the areas published by the area manager component Toaster\_visualizer use informations taken form toaster\_msgs published on specifics ros topics to create markerArray.
toaster\_msgs concerned: AreaList, ObjectList, HumanList
topics concerned: /area\_manager/areaList, /pdg/objList, /pdg/humanList

## Outputs
It publishes markerArray on topics like /toaster\_visualizer/marker\_area, marker\_human, marker\_robot, marker\_motion and marker_objects viewable with RVIZ as shown in images below.

## Future work and possible improvement
In a future work, we would like to improve this visualization by adding the rendering of other facts, such as the one generated by the agent monitoring component about the attention.
